  <h1>Exploratory Analysis: Testing Daily Pregame Sentiment of the New York Mets 2024 Season to Predict Daily Betting Moneylines Movement</h1>
  <p class="meta-info">DS745 | Matt Nelson</p>

  <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>It is generally understood that when sportsbook makers set betting lines, their goal is not to predict the actual outcome of a game, but rather to balance the money wagered on each side... [snipped for brevity in this sample]</p>

  <p>I will be analyzing the daily sentiment...<br>
     ... Lastly, I will combine this data with MGM’s daily betting lines, line movement, and score results from www.sportsbookreview.com into a dataframe.</p>

  <p class='blog-heading'>Data Cleaning and Model Building</p>
  <p>After gathering data from the Reddit API...<br>
     ... Below we see the word cloud showing the most common positive.</p>

  <p class='blog-heading'>Comparing Pregame Sentiment Throughout the Season</p>
  <p>Next, I grouped the comments by game date...<br>
     ...Below is an area map showing the averaged sentiment scores throughout the New York Mets 2024 season.</p>

  <p class='blog-heading'>An Attempt to Connect Daily Sentiment to the Daily Betting Moneylines</p>
  <p>Next, I created a dataframe connecting...<br>
     ...and ‘Streak_Going_into_Game’ is the number of consecutive games won or loss going into the game.</p>
  <img src='mets3.png' alt='Betting Sentiment Correlations'>

  <p>I think there are a few interesting things going on when analyzing the p-values and correlation coefficients:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Statistically significant relationship between winning streaks and pregame sentiment.</li>
    <li>Statistically significant relationship between winning streaks and line movement.</li>
    <li>Opening line seems more influenced by streaks than closing line.</li>
    <li>Closing line better predicts game outcomes.</li>
    <li>Streaks do not predict outcomes directly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class='blog-heading'>Putting It All Together</p>
  <p>The winning or losing streak drives fan sentiment...<br>
     ...the line corrects to reflect a more accurate probability of winning.</p>

  <p class='blog-heading'>Why Understanding Betting Line Movement Matters</p>
  <p>In 2024 season (174 games), if we had bet $100 on every Mets game based on opening line value...<br>
     ...Understanding line movement and why it moves can provide a large payoff over the course of the season.</p>

  <p class='blog-heading'>Next Steps</p>
  <p>This analysis has only looked at Mets fan sentiment from one source...<br>
     ...This would allow us to estimate expected return for future bets.</p>

  <p class='blog-heading'>Conclusion</p>
  <p>We scraped comments from Reddit...<br>
     ...we see how fan sentiment may be playing a role in setting betting lines for Mets games—and potentially for other sports too.</p>
